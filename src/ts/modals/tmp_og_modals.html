            Do not abuse any exploits, additionally if you see someone abusing exploits or you need to report one, please contact me at: computernewbab@gmail.com
            <h3>R5. Don't impersonate other users.</h3>

            <h3>R9. No performing destructive actions constantly.</h3>
            Any user may not destroy the VM (rendering it unusable constantly), install/reinstall the operating system (except on VM7 or VM8), or run bots that do such. This includes bots that spam massive amounts of keyboard/mouse input ("kitting").
            <h3>R10. No Cryptomining</h3>
            Attempting to mine cryptocurrency on the VMs will result in a kick, and then a permanent ban if you keep attempting. Besides, it's not like you're gonna make any money off it.
            <h3>NSFW Warning</h3>
            Please note that NSFW content is allowed on our anarchy VM (VM0b0t), and is viewed regularly. In addition, while we give a good effort to keep NSFW off the main VMs, people will occasionally slip it through.
